# About Me

Hi there! I'm Dang Hoang Gia, but most people call me Zar.

## Background

I'm currently a student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, where I'm pursuing my passion for Computer Engineering. Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by technology and computers. This curiosity led me to choose Computer Engineering as my major, and I haven't looked back since.

## Interests

I have a keen interest in delving deep into the inner workings of computers. Specifically, I'm intrigued by computer performance optimization, understanding how computer architectures function, and exploring various aspects of system-on-chip (SoC) design.

## Goals

My ultimate goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of computer systems and their components. I aspire to contribute to the advancement of technology by leveraging my knowledge and skills in Computer Engineering.

## Hobbies

When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away on my computer, you can find me exploring new technologies, tinkering with hardware, or enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and cycling.

## Get in Touch

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss anything related to computer engineering, exchange ideas, or simply chat about the latest tech trends.

Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
